# Dis Com
---
This is a description of a race of people that live in the world of Threa, the Dis Com.

The Dis Com are a society entirely governed by military command. They are a genderless, egalitarian, meritocratic autocracy

## Appearance
They resemble humans with some rodent-like features, such as wet noses. Their skin is covered in brown fur, they have red hair and green eyes, four-fingered hands, and four-toed feet. They are typically five feet tall with wide round ears and thin tails. Males usually have thicker, darker fur, and bulkier ears and tails, while females have thinner, lighter fur, and more slender ears and tails.

## Classes
There are two main groups, Soldiers and Exiles. Soldiers are divided into 4 classes: Troopers, Sergeants, Specialists, and Officers. Exiles consist of three classes: First Gen, Second Gen, and Third Gen.

Every soldier starts as a Trooper. They form the main labor force, handling infantry, service, and labor tasks. Sergeants are junior command members. Troopers can advance to Sergeant, sharing some tasks with Troopers but also performing their own specific duties. Sergeants lead small groups of Troopers, such as squads and platoons, and serve as sub-commanders and administrators to officers in larger formations. Specialists are highly trained soldiers with expertise in their fields, often working as technicians, teachers, and researchers. Officers handle command roles. Troopers, Sergeants and Specialist can become Officers, leading large formations such as Battalions, Brigades, and Legions, and providing both administrative support and governance. 

Exiles are those expelled from Dis Com society and their descendants. Soldiers convicted of crimes that disrupt unit cohesion or are unbecoming of a soldier are sentenced to execution. However, they are given a mercy of exile: their weapons are dulled, armor broken, and ears notched before being expelled from their forts. If they communicate with a Soldier, the mercy is revoked and they are executed immediately.
Exiles live outside Dis Com society and integrate into other cultures. Some may choose self-exile by abandoning their duties. Their offspring, born in exile, do not experience life as Soldiers. While it is recommended for them to notch their ears, it is not mandatory.
First Gen refers to those who were born Soldiers but later exiled; they must adapt to a new life. Second Gen are born to one or both First Gen parents and learn some aspects of Soldier culture through them. Third Gen have no First Gen parents and are mostly unaware of Soldier culture.

## Attire
The Dis Com have various attire: Barracks Dress, Garrison Dress, Combat Dress, and Mess Dress.
Garrison Dress: Sage cargo pants, service coat, black boots with white or olive gaiters, and a sage patrol cap. Under dress includes short or long sleeve shirts and shorts, in black or olive.
Barracks Dress: A casual version of Garrison Dress. Service coat around the waist, untucked shirts and pants, no cap.
Mess Dress: Formal attire displaying medals and merits. Includes polished boots and gaiters, straight pants, belt, pressed coat, dress shirt, and garrison cap.

Their combat dress includes their garrison dress plus combat armor. The armor is particularly noteworthy. Their standard issue, medium-weight armor is considered highly effective, with only heavy armors from other groups being comparable. In contrast, Dis Com Heavy armor surpasses all heavy armor due to its robust defenses while remaining the lightest in its category. This is achieved through mastery of two manufacturing techniques. The armor plates are composed of composite ceramics treated in high temperature, high-pressure ovens. These plates are mounted on fatigues made of high-density, composite fiber weave. The helmet is made of the same material as the plates, providing high resistance, mobility, and low weight. Their light armor is the Combat Dress without the ceramic plates and is comparable to other medium armors.

Their heavy armor features thicker plates mounted on a thick, high-density body suit and a full head dome helmet. This design limits mobility but provides exceptional protection. The Dis Com heavy armor is highly resistant to various impacts, essentially making the wearer very formidable in the field. However, it requires a strong individual with significant stamina to effectively use the heavy armor, allowing them to be deployed similarly to tanks.

## Weapon
The primary weapon is the Dis Com Rifle. It is important to note that it is not an actual firearm, as firearms do not exist in this fantasy world. The silhouette of the Dis Com Rifle resembles that of real-world M16 and XM8 rifles. Instead of a barrel, it features a single-edged blade embedded in the handguard. Additionally, it has a pistol grip and buttstock.
Weapons in Threa are categorized by three types of damage: slash, pierce, and blunt. Typically, weapons excel in one type of damage but are less effective in the other two. For instance, spears have high pierce damage but only fair slash damage and poor blunt damage. Conversely, clubs have high blunt damage but no pierce or slash damage. The Dis Com Rifle provides balanced damage across all three categories. It is crucial to emphasize that the Dis Com Rifle is not a firearm and does not offer any ranged capabilities; it is purely a melee weapon. The comparison to firearms is solely for illustrative purposes.

The rifle consists of two parts: the carriage and the blade. The carriage includes the buttstock, grip, and guard. The grip affects handling and speed, while the buttstock adds mass for stability and can deal blunt damage. Roughening the buttstock enhances critical blunt damage. The guard increases mass and handling surface, impacting both blunt force and defense, while also supporting the blade's reach.
The blade varies in shape, affecting slash and pierce damage. Its length and integration with the guard determine reach. A single-sided blade can have a serrated edge for critical slash damage or a hooked tip for critical pierce damage. Heavier, thicker blades increase blunt force, and deeper embedding into the guard further enhances this. A wider guard can support an additional blade.
Carriages are typically made from hard woods, compressed woods, soft woods for padding, and metals (used to roughen the buttstock). Blades are generally metal or ceramic, though stone can be used for lower quality.

Ratings range from 1 to 5, with zero indicating absence.
The ratings are as follows: None, Low, Fair, Good, High, Excellent.
Categories: Slash, Pierce, Blunt, Reach, Speed, Defense, Effect
There are several variants of the Dis Com Rifle, each with distinct characteristics:   
* Standard Rifle: This basic model features a blade that curves to a point. It has ratings of: Good for Slash, Pierce, Blunt, Reach, Speed, and Defense.    
* Carbine Rifle: A shorter version of the rifle designed for increased speed at the cost of reach. It has ratings of: Good for Slash, Pierce, Blunt, and Speed; Fair for Reach and Defense.
* Pistol Rifle: Essentially just the grip with minimal guard and no buttstock, featuring a short blade and commonly used as a side weapon. It has ratings of: Good for Slash and Pierce; Low for Blunt, Reach, and Defense; High for Speed. *Effect*: Can be dual-wielded.
* Shotgun Rifle: This variant has a thicker, heavier carriage and a short guard with the blade mostly embedded in the guard. It has ratings of: Fair for Slash, Reach, and Speed; Low for Pierce; High for Blunt and Defense. *Effect*: Can be dual-wielded.
* Sniper Rifle: Featuring a longer, sturdier guard and an extended blade for a sharper tip, this variant has ratings of: Good for Slash and Blunt; Excellent for Pierce; High for Reach; Low for Speed; Fair for Defense. *Effect*: High critical damage from pierce attacks.
* Launcher Rifle: Primarily composed of the carriage, with a very heavy buttstock and guard, and a thicker, heavier blade with barely exposed edges. Preferred by juggernauts, it has ratings of: Good for Slash and Reach; None for Pierce; Low for Speed; Excellent for Blunt and Defense. *Effect*: Area Damage.

## Ranks
Every soldier has a rank, and each one has a casual nickname for friendly chats.
### Trooper Ranks:
Every soldier starts as a trooper. They're raised in a Discipline Corp unit till they graduate. First, they're in a Training Unit till their late teens, then move on to a Doctrine Unit for four years. They graduate when they reach early adulthood and start their service unless they wash out.
* Recruit (rookie): Everyone begins as a recruit. They stay at this rank until they graduate. Anyone who hasn't graduated from their doctrine unit, including washouts, retains this rank.

* Trooper First Class (ace): The next rank, and recruits can sometimes graduate straight to this level.
* Senior Trooper (veteran): A highly experienced trooper.
* Lancer (Sham Sergeant): Has some light leadership roles.
* Corporal (Gofer): Veteran troopers with more leadership roles, often the sergeant's right-hand person.
* Reserve Trooper (Senior Rookie, Chief Rookie, General Rookie): If a recruit washes out, they're assigned to labor units or honor units but can be retrained and graduated to trooper if they want. They're still drilled with basic combat skills every year. After two years of not graduating, they're designated as reserves. If needed, they might be fielded in combat. Though not as good as a regular combat unit, they're still on par with soldiers from other armies.

### Sergeant Ranks:
Senior Trooper, Lancer, and Corporal can apply to become Sergeants, trained at the Collegium.

### Specialist Ranks:
Experienced troopers and sergeants in technical units (except for combat, command, discipline, medical, and most of recon (only cartographers and historians can)) can move up as specialist officers. Their training isn't too strict. It's still watched over by the Discipline Corps, but it happens through an apprenticeship with a current specialist officer.
* Apprentice (Pupil): A soldier learning from a technical officer.
* Specialist (Chief): They give advice at the company level.
* Expert Specialist (Expert Chief): They advise at the battalion, regiment, and fort levels, and they join the Discipline Corps as technical officers.
* Master Specialist (Master Chief): They serve as advisors to supreme command.

### Officer Ranks:
Troopers, Sergeants, and Specialists of any rank are eligible to apply for officer positions. They are required to complete Training and may bypass Doctrine, proceeding directly to the Lyceum with tribunal approval.
* Plebe (Twerp): While undergoing training at the Lyceum.
* Lieutenant (Junior): Upon graduation, leads platoons comprised of two or more squads. Sergeants serve as their sub-commanders.
* Captain (Cap): Commands companies, which typically include four platoons. Staff Sergeants serve as their sub-commanders.
* Major (Striker): Leads battalions.
* Colonel (Commander): Commands regiments.
* High Colonel (Top): Special assignment for a Colonel, leading the central command of forts.
* Lieutenant General (Starlight): Commands brigades and multi-fort formations; part of supreme command.

### Non-Active Duty Ranks:
 For Retired, Deceased, and Exiles
* Soldier-at-Rest (Legionnaire, Old Guard): This is for a retired soldier. They can't move up in rank anymore, so "at-rest" gets added to their retired rank, like Lancer-at-rest. They can still help out with work, farming, honor stuff, and discipline, but they can't be sent to the front lines.
* Soldier-at-Peace (Oathkeeper): This one’s for a soldier who’s passed away or died in battle. Their rank gets amended with "at-peace," like Lancer-at-peace.
  
The deceased are Oathkeepers, the living are WarFighters, and those exiled are HonorBreakers.

## Forts

The Dis Com are highly secretive and isolated. the build impenetrable walls surrounding all the land they use. nobody goes in or out without permission of the Grand General and their officers. The land however is not theirs. a foreign state allows for the use of their land in exchange for the Dis Com to answer the other state's Call to Arms. They know that any formation sent by the Dis Com would be at least 3 times more capable than their own forces

Each fort operates as an independent city-state. They function autonomously from one another, although materials, resources, and troops are exchanged between them. Each fort comprises various units, primarily combat units, and also includes several specialized units. Governance is managed by Central Command, which consists of unit commanders up to the fort commander. Each fort is led by a High Colonel and their Master Sergeant. Central Command mission is to ensure the readiness of the hosted combat units.

In addition to Central Command, there is Supreme Command, which oversees not only the forts but also inter-fort movements. Supreme Command effectively governs all the forts and is led by the Supreme General and their Grand Sergeant, stationed at The Citadel. The Citadel, along with The Academy and The Sanctuary, is one of three territories fully controlled by the Dis Com, unlike other forts that lease land from other states. The Citadel functions as the capital of the Dis Com.

* Outposts are The smallest fort, the outpost, contains the essentials for operation. It hosts small units from each corps, including combat and command units. Logistic and signal units support management by supreme command. Additional units such as labor, mess hall, engineer, and medical ensure combat units stay focused. Outposts rely on other forts or host states for support and are used for low presence or temporary missions.

* Garrisons are the next size of forts, which field agrarian units allowing food production and support more combat units. They also include Training and Doctrine Units to develop their own forces, along with custodial, engineering, logistics, and signal units. Furthermore, they may have Valor and Honor units, as well as Materiel, Forge, Workshop, and Loom units.

* Bastions are larger than Garrisons, housing additional agrarian and specialized combat units, including mount units. They also have Armory units for weapon and armor manufacturing, technical units for training specialized forces, and tribunal units. Bastions hold the lease for their land and the dependent Garrisons and Outposts, enabling them to operate self-sufficiently.

* Fortresses are the largest forts. They feature extensive fortifications built by experienced engineering units and are staffed by police units. They host the highest concentration of combat units with various specializations, including Juggernaut training. They possess multiple technical units, significant agrarian and labor units, and vast armories.

* The Citadel, The Academy, and The Sanctuary are even more fortified than Fortresses, though their combat forces resemble those of a Bastion. They lack numerous agrarian, materiel, loom, forge, and armory units, making them reliant on other Bastions and Fortresses by design. However, they have ample Valor, Honor, signal, and logistic units. Protecting The Sanctuary, The Academy, and The Citadel takes top priority for all Dis Com forces, in that order.
  * The Citadel is the headquarters of Supreme Command
  * The Academy is the headquarters of Discipline Corps 
  * The Sanctuary is the headquarters of Medical Corps


## Corps

The Combat Corps is the largest corps in the Legion, with every fort hosting combat units. The mission of every forts is to ensure the readiness of these units. The divisions within the Combat Corps include:
* Infantry: The majority of combat units are infantry. Troopers may be assigned to an infantry unit upon graduation as their initial assignment. When not actively deployed, they continuously participate in training exercises.
* Cavalry: Cavalry units utilize mounts raised by agrarian units.
* Siege: These units operate siege machinery created by engineer units, such as rams, towers, ladders, and catapults.
* Blitz: Blitz units consist of light infantry wearing light armor to enhance speed and mobility, and are equipped with carbine rifles.
* Juggernaut: Heavy infantry units, known as Juggernauts, wear a body suit that provides significant defense for the wielder. 

Recon units can support combat units with extra capabilities, such as cartographers for map details and vanguards for scouting. Covert units may also integrate to achieve further objectives.

---

* Agrarian Corps is the second largest Corp focused on food production. The Dis Com are exclusively vegan, so the Agrarian Corps harvests a wide variety of crops, with rice and corn being the primary ones. They also cultivate cotton for textiles, as well as supplemental crops such as wheat, oats, fruits, and vegetables. Additionally, they have a division dedicated to raising mounts for the cavalry divisions and supply corps, and they produce wool for textiles.

* The Labor Corps performs various labor-intensive tasks. The Materiel Division handles lumber and mining, while the Forge and Workshop Division manages manufacturing. They can create various tools and objects. The Loom Division produces textiles like garrison dress, underdress, mess dress, and other clothing accessories. Custodial and Laundry Divisions take care of cleaning and janitorial duties. The Labor Corps also runs the Mess Hall, responsible for food preparation, service, and ration manufacturing. Rations are ready-to-eat meals provided to troops before or during deployment, eliminating the need for a kitchen in the field. 

* The Engineer Corps is responsible for the construction and maintenance of buildings, forts, carts, and carriages. Engineers are skilled in various repair, light construction, and machining tasks. Wreckers specialize in demolition work, clearing and leveling land, and other earthworks. Builders construct various buildings, roads, and other infrastructure projects. Masons focus on stonework and fortifications, including building outer walls for bastions, fortresses, and capitals. Mechanics handle the manufacturing and repair of carts, wagons, and other wheeled vehicles, as well as constructing other machines such as construction lifts.

* The Armory is a specialized corps responsible for the production of weapons and armor. It is divided into three primary divisions: the Weapons Division, the Armor Division, and the Weave Division. The Weapons Division crafts the Dis Com Rifle and its variants, the Armor Division manufactures ceramic plates, and the Weave Division produces high-density composite textiles and the juggernaut body suit. The Armory operates independently from the forge, workshop, and loom divisions to minimize the number of individuals with knowledge of the crafting processes for their armor and weapons. 

* The Logistics Corps manages the logistics, transport, and distribution of supplies, materials, and personnel. They oversee operations within the fort, across various locations, and on the battlefield. Nothing moves without the knowledge of the Logistics Corps. They collaborate with the Agrarian Unit for field beasts of burden and with engineers for carts and wagons to build their transport fleets. Every corps reports to the Logistics Corps regarding inventories, such as the amount harvested, the number of shirts available, the rations on hand, and the destinations of lumber. The only exception is the Medical Corps, which provides minimal data to the Logistics Corps. Additionally, the Logistics Corps handles any requests for supplies, materials, and personnel, ensuring these requests are fulfilled. They also operate local supply stores, warehouses, and shops where soldiers can obtain personal supplies and rations.

* The Signal Corps is responsible for all communications, handling requests and orders within and between forts, across battlefields, and to external locations. The Liaison Division manages inter-fort communications and messaging to foreign states, including the state that owns the land on which the fort is situated. Liaison units frequently travel outside the forts, making them knowledgeable about the world beyond the fort walls. They are trained to maintain secrecy during these travels and are often targeted by external states. Liaisons also maintain communication with exile communities. Some Liaisons have notched ears to blend in with exiles; however, their notches differ from those of exiles to be recognized by the Signal Corps. If they do not use proper channels, they risk summary execution. Couriers are tasked with delivering orders from Command units to combat and combat support units, ensuring that orders are conveyed as quickly and securely as possible. Additionally, the Signal Corps operates the Post Office, which handles non-operational correspondence, primarily enabling soldiers to stay in touch with one another as they move between forts. Liaison, along with Logistics, facilitates trade with other states. The Dis Com themselves do not use money; instead, they trade surplus production from agrarian and materiel units or even conquer territory as payment. As part of their lease agreements, they may be required to mine for precious stones and metals, which are materials that the Dis Com does not utilize. 

* Valor Corps deals with promotion and punishment. the police division enforce laws and administer punishment, from additional labor duties, incarceration, demotion, exile and execution. Sentries man the fort walls and are the first line of defense, before combat units can be mobilized. the Tribunal is the division that deals with judging if the soldier is to be punished. they also judge promotions and awards. The Valor Corps is responsible for both promotions and disciplinary actions. The police division enforces laws and administers punishments, which may include additional labor duties, incarceration, demotion, exile, or execution. Sentries are stationed at the fort walls, serving as the first line of defense until combat units can be mobilized. The Tribunal division adjudicates matters related to disciplinary actions, as well as evaluates promotions and awards. The Honor Corps is responsible for maintaining morale by handling recreation, entertainment, and ceremonies. They include athletes, performers, musicians, thespians, and bards. They manage recreational spaces such as lounges, playgrounds, and sports fields. They also organize various ceremonies, including promotions, funeral rites, change of command, and parades.  

* The Honor Corps is task to maintain Morale. they deal with recreation, entertainment and ceremony. They have athletes, performers, musicians, thespians, bards. they administer recreation spaces, lounges, playgrounds, and sports fields. they also organize ceremonies, promotions ceremonies, funeral rites, change of command and parades.  This is the other corps, besides Labor Corps in which those unable to serve as Troopers end up at.

* The Recon Corps is responsible for intelligence gathering. They include cartographers, historians, vanguards, and forward observers. They also handle covert units, such as spies, infiltrators, and assassins. Recon units can be deployed to any fort, ranging from outposts to fortresses, at the discretion of Supreme Command. Cartographers and historians work independently within the forts. Vanguard and scout units support combat units under Supreme Command. Covert recon units are also dispatched as needed, with their identities concealed and potentially integrated into other units, such as agrarian units.

## Disipline Corps

The Discipline Corps is headquartered at the Academy. Along with its own supreme command, led by a lieutenant general and a major sergeant, it has four divisions: Training, Doctrine, Technical, and Crucible.
The Training Division handles basic education. When a member of the Discipline Corps is born, they are assigned to a Training Platoon. They learn reading, writing, mathematics, history, fitness, and other fundamental subjects, continuing until their late teens.

The Doctrine Division focuses on combat and battlefield knowledge, weapons training, drills, discipline, readiness, and unit cohesion. Initial combat doctrine training lasts about four years. Upon completing this training, recruits become Troopers; prior to this, they were known as recruits (formally) or rookies (informally). Training continues throughout their careers.

The Technical Division covers specialist fields like agriculture, engineering, and judicial roles, excluding medical training, which is handled by the Medical Corps. The duration of training varies depending on the field.

The Crucible Division manages the training of Sergeants and officers. The Collegium trains the Sergeants, and The Lyceum trains officers. Any Trooper can become a Sergeant, and any Trooper or Sergeant can become an officer.

Soldiers who have been trained in technical units may begin an apprenticeship to become Specialists. They can continue serving as experienced soldiers within their units or join the Discipline Corps. Although anyone can join the Discipline Corps, Specialists may join as instructors if there are available positions. The training for instructors takes place at the academy. Once trained, they may be assigned as detachments to various forts, focusing on training, doctrine, or technical units. When instructors gain sufficient experience, they may become part of the Academy's personnel. 

### Cadre

They have no concept of family or familial relationships. After birth, they are separated from their parents and placed in a Cadre Unit. Their sex and parentage are recorded but kept secret. Each cadre squad is led by a junior sergent and a trooper. Effectively, these two act as their parental figures. They train together for 15 years, forming close bonds akin to sibling relationships. Even after graduating and serving in different units, they maintain contact with their former cadre squad. 

Cadre units consist of young recruits who are placed into squads soon after birth. Each cadre squad comprises no more than six recruits, typically four but ideally two. The recruits' ages may vary. Any trooper or sergeant may be assigned the additional duty of leading and caring for a cadre squad. They have the option to refuse this assignment up to three times but must accept it on the fourth occasion. Senior Troopers and junior sergeants are preferred for this role. These troopers and sergeants continue to serve their primary units while overseeing their cadre squads. They are commonly referred to as cadre leads.
Four squads are overseen by an officer and sergeant as part of their cadre command. A training unit, a squad or platoon of training instructors and support staff, will instruct recruits. They are referred to as Training school. After graduating from the training school, recruits advance to a doctrine school for four years, where a Doctrine unit will continue to instruct recruits. Training units can be found in all forts except in outpost, so any cadre stationed at outpost would need to travel to another nearby fort to attend a training or doctrine school. Doctrine schools are located at bastions and fortreses, so cadre units in garrison will need transport to attend doctrine schools. Some doctrine schools may house recruits, boarding, rather than having them commute between forts. The training school focuses on basic education, while the doctrine school provides basic combat training. Upon graduation from the doctrine school, recruits are promoted to Troopers, assigned their initial posts of service, and leave the cadre platoon. Those who fail to graduate are assigned as reserve troopers and sent to labor, agrarian, or honor units.
Once all recruits have graduated and departed for their initial posts, the cadre squad disbands. The sergeant and trooper are relieved of their responsibilities for the cadre squad. It is common for recruits and their cadre leads to maintain contact throughout their lives.
Cadre squads are accommodated in designated barracks rooms. The sergeant and trooper, cadre leads reside with their recruits. The cadre leads and may choose to continue living together or separate after the cadre squad disbands, at least until they receive a new assignment.
The Dis Com have no familial relationships or concept of family. They do not know their siblings, parents, or children, nor do they understand these concepts. Instead, their cadre squad fulfills the role of a family unit. The sergeant and trooper, cadre leads, assume parental roles for the recruits, with fellow recruits serving as siblings. The cadre command of the platoon functions as grandparents, while other squads within the platoon are considered cousins, aunts, and uncles. Training school serves as early education, doctrine school resembles high school, the Collegium represents colleges, and the Lyceum is akin to a university.
After the cadre squad disbands, its members continue to keep in touch throughout their lives. They tend to maintain regular correspondence and may even attend each other’s promotions and other events. 

## The Academy

The academy has a central command, just like any other forts. Supreme command oversees the Discipline corps, responsible for educational and training activities across the legion. Central command manages the academy's infrastructure, services, and specialized units, ensuring maintenance, ration distribution, cleanliness, and protection. To ensure instructor quality, the academy does not train its own units but instead attaches units trained at various forts. 
Using external units allows the evaluation of instructors to ensure the Discipline Corps is effectively fulfilling its mission. This evaluation is conducted in two ways. First, if the operations run smoothly, it indicates sound training. Since the attached units come from different locations and are unfamiliar with each other, they must rely on their training to accomplish tasks.
Second, supreme command submits requests to central command to observe how the units respond. For example, if a change in rations is requested, the management of this adjustment by agrarian units can be evaluated. If outcomes do not meet expectations, further investigation may be necessary to understand the reasons behind the actions. This insight can then be used to modify the curriculum.
The academy's units focus on maintaining operations so that the Discipline Corps can concentrate on their mission. They are not part of the Discipline Corps and do not fall under its direct command. Despite the capability to train their own units, the academy opts not to, so they can evaluate training at other forts through the attached units. The main function of these units is to sample the training occurring at various forts.

Academy unit rotations are managed according to different fort rotations based on unit type. The central command of the Academy assesses its needs and, if two agrarian companies are required, they will send a request to the next fort in the rotation for agrarian units. The central command of the requested fort will evaluate their units and send back an evaluation. If the fort can fulfill the request immediately, they will do so without evaluation. If only part of the request can be fulfilled, they will send what is available along with their evaluation. If the request cannot be fulfilled immediately, only the evaluation will be sent. The Academy will review the evaluation if their request was not met. They may order the fort to fulfill it regardless or send a new request to the next fort in the rotation for the remaining units.
The requested fort has the discretion to choose any of its units to meet the request. They may operate with reduced ranks until their attached units return or request the training of new units. Units attached to the Academy are there temporarily, stationed for two to four years. Afterwards, they may request an extension to stay, return to their previous fort, or be stationed at another fort. 


A challenge is that the Academy is fairly protected and isolated, far from any frontline. This tends to lead their instructors and supreme command to deviate from a practical approach in their curriculum and adopt more hypothetical approaches, resulting in units being improperly trained. These units may face significant risks due to their sub-par training. The citadel typically addresses issues with these instructors.





## The Sanctuary

The Sanctuary serves as the headquarters for the medical corps, which independently manages its own instruction, logistics, tribunal, and signal needs. Soldiers wishing to join must be approved by the medical tribunal. To maintain secrecy, the medical corps has duplicate components under the guise of operational efficiency. The medical corps enforces a genderless society to promote comradeship by eliminating gender distinctions. Unlike other races that deploy single-gender armies, Dis Com can utilize their entire population. Medical units need to know patients' genders, so they remain isolated. Members of the medical corps are bound to stay once they join.
Outposts field a medic post, typically manned by a team of two medics. Garrisons have infirmaries, bastions have clinics, and fortresses have hospitals. The sanctuary itself also functions as a hospital. Hospitals are where soldiers are sequestered for procreation; the “Quarantine Division” is actually the maternity division. Soldiers sequestered for quarantine are informed that they have an illness requiring isolation. They are kept in individual rooms with low light. Males undergo induced symptoms similar to pregnancy, including inflammation, fatigue, vomiting, swelling, and painful deflation. Once the child is born, parents recover and then return to their units. Due to the consistent experience, isolation, and dim lighting, soldiers believe they were genuinely ill. After a few weeks of care, the child is sent to another fort and assigned to a cadre squad.
The Logistics Corps maintains a service file on each soldier, while the Medical Corps maintains separate medical and secret files containing the soldier's gender and lineage. This secret file is initially stored at the hospital where the soldier was born. After several years, both medical and secret files are moved to the sanctuary. Medics posts, infirmaries, and clinics may request the medical file if treating a soldier. The medical file may travel to any medical facility, but the secret file may only travel between hospitals and clinics. If an infirmary holds the medical file and a hospital retains the secret file, the facility with the secret file may request the medical file to be returned.
In addition to instruction, logistics, signal tribunal, and 'quarantine' divisions, the medical corps includes divisions specializing in various medical practices:
Medics: General knowledge of medicine, capable of practicing and being deployed anywhere, primarily in field medicine. At least two medics are required for a medic post.
Doctors: General medicine practitioners who treat most cases, typically found in the rear of battlefields, infirmaries, clinics, and hospitals.
Surgeons: Specialists in severe injuries, commonly found in clinics and hospitals, and sometimes deployed in the rear of the battlefield.
Alchemists: Creators of potions, tinctures, salves, and other remedies, usually stationed in clinics and hospitals, and occasionally deployed at the battlefield rear.
Stewards: Caretakers of retired soldiers or those unable to continue due to medical reasons, exclusively found in hospitals and not deployed.
Nurses: Assistants to all medical specialists except for medics. Technically, one of the two medics—the junior soldier—assumes the tasks of the nurse, while the senior soldier assumes the roles of doctor, surgeon, or alchemist.

## Exiles
If a soldier discovers their gender, they may exhibit unusual behavior, disrupt the peace, and jeopardize unit cohesion. Such actions are considered unbecoming of a soldier. In response, the authorities will detain the individual and refer them to a valor tribunal. If the valor tribunal suspects a case of gender discovery, the matter is escalated to a medical tribunal. Upon confirmation of gender discovery, the individual is sentenced to execution, which essentially means exile.
A significant number of exiles result from decisions made by medical tribunals, not solely due to gender discovery. Medical personnel, who are aware of their own gender, might engage in relationships. Medics are strictly prohibited from pursuing romantic relationships or becoming romantically involved. However, some romances do occur, potentially leading to complications. As these relationships threaten unit cohesion, those involved are subjected to execution (exile). Some couples may choose self-exile or deliberately seek execution to live together outside the society.
Medical soldiers, for any infraction, are immediately referred to medical tribunals without the involvement of valor tribunals. The higher incidence of exiles within the medical corps, attributed to breaches of unit cohesion, is used by supreme command to justify maintaining the policy of unknown genders. This approach continues to be endorsed due to incidents where individuals prioritize personal relationships over their duties and societal responsibilities. 



Valor Tribunals and Medical Tribunals possess the authority to sentence soldiers. The range of penalties that can be imposed includes reprimand, labor, incarceration, demotion, and execution.
Reprimand is a verbal action, either private or public, aimed at shaming the individual. Labor involves temporary reassignment to a Labor Unit, typically in Custodial units. this option is not available to Medical Tribunals, as Medical Soldiers cannot leave the medical Corps. Incarceration entails removing the individual from their unit and jailing them for a period of time. Depending on the length of incarceration, they may be reassigned to a labor unit upon release. Demotion reduces their rank; Officers and Sergeants may be demoted to Trooper if their rank is sufficiently low. Execution results in the termination of the individual's life without any honors. However, upon being sentenced to execution, they are granted a mercy known as Exile. Their armor is broken, their rifle is dulled, and their ears are notched before they are expelled from the fort, never to return. Exiles are forbidden from communicating with any Militant Dis Com. If an exile even greets a Militant Dis Com, they forfeit their mercy, and any present Dis Com has the authority to carry out their execution.
The armor is broken and rifles dulled to show mercy, as the exiled will face the unknown. They keep their armament for better survival chances. However, pristine armament is valuable outside and could be used against Dis Com or replicated. By damaging them, this risk is reduced. Even in a damaged state, exiled armament matches common gear, but without access to a Dis Com Armory, it can't be repaired. 
Exile communities help each other navigate life outside the Forts. New generations born outside can choose to notch their ears. Few attempt to engage with Dis Com Soldiers, often leading to their demise.

The struggles faced by exiles vary depending on their generation. First-generation exiles were born as soldiers, raised within the confines of the Legion, but are now permanently disconnected from everything they have ever known. They understand that approaching a Soldier Dis Com is not an option, as they once held similar positions and would not hesitate to eliminate an exile.
Second-generation exiles, on the other hand, were born outside the Dis Com soldier society and experience aspects of the soldier lifestyle only through their first-generation parents. Frequently, they choose to notch their ears at the request of their parents.
Third-generation exiles, who also are born outside, have parents with minimal knowledge of soldier society. Often, they opt to go unnotched, mistakenly believing they can infiltrate Dis Com Forts and accomplish something significant. However, upon discovery, they are executed. Without the guidance and emphasis from the first generation to avoid contact with soldiers at all costs, they tend to approach soldiers, ultimately leading to their demise.

## Command Corps

The Command Corps serve as the leadership of the Dis Com and their administrative staff. There are three divisions: Supreme Command, Central Command, and Orderlies. Supreme Command oversees operations across the entire legion, including Combat, Signal, Logistics, The Armory, and Recon units. Central Command manages the maintenance and operations of individual forts, overseeing Agrarian, Labor, Engineering, Valor, and Honor units. The Orderlies division encompasses the support staff responsible for clerical work, scribing, labor, and other duties in service of command officers.
Central Command operates under the authority of Supreme Command. While the Supreme Command may consider input from Central Command, it is the duty of Central Command to execute the orders given by Supreme Command to the best of their ability. For instance, should the Supreme Command require a new building, they will submit a request to Central Command. Central Command will then evaluate the request and provide an assessment, after which the Supreme Command will issue their orders. To construct the building, Central Command must mobilize engineers. If all engineers are currently assigned to critical tasks and cannot be reassigned, and if nearby forts cannot supply engineers within the requested timeframe, the Supreme Command has two options: they can either agree to a delay or order the reassignment of engineers to the new building project, accepting any consequences that arise from disregarding Central Command's recommendations. The Citadel may subsequently review these actions and consequences and take disciplinary action against the Supreme Command if necessary. 
In times of emergency, central assume command over supreme, Central may direct its own combat units. Alternatively, central may relinquish its command over to supreme, for supreme to use the forts support units directly. Still, it is better for central to assume command and supreme to take advisory roles


The academy and sanctuary supreme command act as extensions of the main supreme command at the citadel. Each fort has its own supreme command detachment. The Lieutenant Generals at the academy and sanctuary report to the Supreme General at the citadel but enjoy more autonomy compared to other corps based at the citadel. 


All corps, except for instruction and medical, are headquartered at the citadel under supreme command. Logistics, Signal, and Recon have a greater presence there, subordinate to supreme command. Agrarian, Labor, and Engineer have a lower presence and are led by colonels and Master Sergeants, still under supreme command but mainly reporting to each fort's central command. Valor and Honor corps have the smallest presence, each led by a Major and Lance Sergeants, nearly autonomous from supreme command but not from central command. Each fort may have its own laws, awards, celebrations, and festivities that are managed by the Valor and Honor Corps. Combat Corps is directly commanded by supreme command.
